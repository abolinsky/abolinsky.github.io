I feel completely comfortable saying that my daily routine of learning Kanji is entirely a habit now. If I miss a day, something feels really off - and I then have reviews piling up, which makes more work for the day or two afterwards.

Tonight I completely filled my first notebook with Kanji. The book includes my studies every day between 3 November 2017 and 4 January 2018, with the exception of 5 November, 26 November, and 26 December, which are days that I missed. I decided to scan in the entire notebook (80 pages) and turn the resulting scanned pages into an animation, which I've put below.

As of tonight, I have learned 1340 Kanji (not including readings).
