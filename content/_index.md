Hi, I'm Alexander Bolinsky.

I'm a software engineer and educator living in Tokyo and working to empower the next generation of engineers and makers at [Woven by Toyota](https://woven.toyota/) and [Tokyo Coding Club](https://tokyocodingclub.co.jp/). I also teach squash at [Tokyo American Club](https://www.tokyoamericanclub.org/).

In my spare time I'm building things, learning Nepali and Japanese, biohacking, reading, cooking, tinkering with electronics, traveling, and dancing like a fool with [菊水連](https://www.kikusuiren.com/).

Most recently a friend and I built [subletters.fun](https://www.subletters.fun)!
