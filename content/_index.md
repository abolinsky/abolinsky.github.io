# Alexander Bolinsky

I am a software engineer and educator living in Tokyo and working to empower the next generation of engineers and makers at [Woven by Toyota](https://woven.toyota/) and [Tokyo Coding Club](https://tokyocodingclub.co.jp/).

In my spare time I am building random things, reading, cooking, learning languages, and dancing like a fool with [菊水連](https://www.kikusuiren.com/).

Most recently a friend and I built [subletters.fun](https://www.subletters.fun)!
