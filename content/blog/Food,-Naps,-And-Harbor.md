I slept for almost twelve hours after hiking Dragon's Back, and when I woke up, I realized I hadn't eaten anything in almost 24 hours. So I found this delicious Japanese restaurant on my street that was open at 7:15am and grabbed some food to go for myself and one of my hostel-mates. <img class='post-img' src='/img/travel/SE_Asia/Day4/IMG_20170721_072218.jpeg'/><img class='post-img' src='/img/travel/SE_Asia/Day4/IMG_20170721_074221.jpeg'/> Then I took a nap. When I woke up, I bought my 21-day Japanese Rail Pass, was hungry for some lunch, and went out in search of a pastry shop because I was craving pork floss and red bean paste buns. Sure enough a few blocks and turns away, I found just the place. <img class='post-img' src='/img/travel/SE_Asia/Day4/IMG_20170721_120036.jpeg'/><img class='post-img' src='/img/travel/SE_Asia/Day4/IMG_20170721_120105.jpeg'/> When I got back, I ate and then for the rest of the afternoon I was half studying Japanese and half napping. When I finally came to, I met three new roommates and ventured out to find dinner with two of them. We ended up in the third floor of a market that was so cold we could see our breath as if we were sitting in an open-floor freezer. <img class='post-img' src='/img/travel/SE_Asia/Day4/IMG_20170721_191329.jpeg'/> I actually thought it felt amazing, considering about 30% of my body was now sunburned, but soon enough we were out and explored Wan Chai toward the harbor facing mainland Hong Kong. The humidity was low at about 70%, and there was a slight breeze blowing in from the harbor, which made for a nice evening out. The city lights were beautiful, both in and across the water. <img class='post-img' src='/img/travel/SE_Asia/Day4/IMG_20170721_201115.jpeg'/><img class='post-img' src='/img/travel/SE_Asia/Day4/IMG_20170721_203946~2.jpeg'/> And of course there was this guy, asking to get his butt kicked in arm wrestling by the pier. <img class='post-img' src='/img/travel/SE_Asia/Day4/IMG_20170721_204718~2.jpeg'/>

All in all, lazy day.
