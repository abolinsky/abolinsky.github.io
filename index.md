# Alexander Bolinsky

I am a software engineer and educator living in Tokyo and working to empower the next generation of engineers and makers at Woven Planet and [Tokyo Coding Club](https://tokyocodingclub.co.jp/).

In my spare time I am playing squash, building random things, reading, cooking, learning Japanese, and dancing like a fool with [菊水連](https://www.kikusuiren.com/).
