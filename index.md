# Alexander Bolinsky

I am a software developer at *LockerDome* in St. Louis, MO. While there, I have worked with the full stack, splitting my time between low-level bit twiddling, memory management, and instruction optimization on their custom database, their api and back-end framework, and some UI/UX.

My interests include embedded systems and hardware design, software architecture, robotic sensing, and the intersection between technology, health, and medicine.

I am most proficient with C++, x86 assembly, and javascript.
