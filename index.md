# Alexander Bolinsky

I am a software engineer living in Tokyo and working to empower lives with connected machines at [Rapyuta Robotics](https://www.rapyuta-robotics.com).

In my spare time I am learning Japanese, reading science fiction, eating sushi, and dancing like a fool with [菊水連](https://www.kikusuiren.com/).
