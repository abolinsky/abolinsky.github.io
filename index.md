# Alexander Bolinsky

I am a software developer that recently left **LockerDome** to spend some time traveling. While at LockerDome, I worked on everything from hand-coding architecture-specific x86 assembly and implementing a custom memory manager to asynchronous socket programming and data (de)serialization to unit testing to static type checking for a front-end javascript framework compiler to implementing a lexer/parser to api and application development to HTML DOM manipulation to basic UI/UX.

In my spare time I fiddle with embedded devices, microcontrollers, and to a lesser extent FPGAs. I like dirtying my hands with the lower levels of software, and I am deeply interested in the intersection between technology, health, and medicine.

In my spare, spare time I am learning Japanese, traveling, camping, playing Go, strumming the guitar, plucking the guzheng, eating sushi, and [doing flashmobs](https://youtu.be/FkLPztcET3w).
