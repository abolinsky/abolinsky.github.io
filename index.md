# Alexander Bolinsky

I am a software developer that recently left **LockerDome** to spend some time traveling. While at LockerDome, I worked on everything from hand-coding architecture-specific x86 assembly and implementing a custom memory manager to asynchronous socket programming and data (de)serialization to unit testing to static type checking for a front-end javascript framework compiler to implementing a lexer/parser to api and application development to HTML DOM manipulation to basic UI/UX.

In my spare time I also work with embedded devices, microcontrollers, and to a lesser extent FPGAs. As you can probably tell, I like dirtying my hands with the lower levels of software. I am deeply interested in the intersection between technology, health, and medicine, and I am currently working on a project with a few others involving sleep disorders, using this project as an opportunity to practice developing good system architectures.

In my spare, spare time, I love to camp, hike, travel, play the guitar and guzheng, and eat sushi.
