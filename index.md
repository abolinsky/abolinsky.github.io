# Alexander Bolinsky

I am a software engineer living in Tokyo and working to empower the next generation of engineers, makers, and tinkerers at [Tokyo Coding Club](https://tokyocodingclub.co.jp/).

In my spare time I am building machines and furniture, learning Japanese, reading science fiction, eating sushi, and dancing like a fool with [菊水連](https://www.kikusuiren.com/).
