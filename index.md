# Alexander Bolinsky

I am a software engineer living in Tokyo and working to empower the next generation of engineers, makers, and tinkerers at [Tokyo Coding Club](https://tokyocodingclub.co.jp/).

In my spare time I am climbing, building things, reading, cooking, learning Japanese, and dancing like a fool with [菊水連](https://www.kikusuiren.com/).
I am also building [goodsourcecode.org](https://www.goodsourcecode.org)!
