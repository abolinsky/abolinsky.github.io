# Alexander Bolinsky

I am a software engineer working to empower lives with connected machines at [**Rapyuta Robotics**](www.rapyuta-robotics.com) at their office in Tokyo.

In my spare time I am learning Japanese, exploring Japan, fiddling with embedded devices, microcontrollers, and FPGAs, playing Go, eating sushi, and reading in parks.
